## When implementing features:

- Write changes **as if you will teach them live**.
- For every meaningful change, add/update a short doc in `../ai-driven/workshop/` with:
  - **Goal** - What we're building and why
  - **Prereqs** - What you need before starting
  - **Live steps** - Numbered, copy/paste commands
  - **Verification** - How to confirm it worked
  - **Common failures** - Symptom → fix pairs
- Prefer **checklist-first**, then add a small **Appendix** with the "why" and troubleshooting.
- Keep docs concise and demo-friendly: short sections, clear headings, minimal fluff.

## Quick Access

```bash
# Open workshop repo
cd ../ai-driven && ls workshop/

# Create new workshop doc
cd ../ai-driven/workshop && touch XX-feature-name.md
```
