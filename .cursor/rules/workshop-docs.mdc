When implementing features in this repo:

- Write changes **as if you will teach them live**.
- For every meaningful change, add/update a short doc in `workshop/` with:
  - **Goal**
  - **Prereqs**
  - **Live steps** (numbered, copy/paste commands)
  - **Verification** (how to confirm it worked)
  - **Common failures** (symptom → fix)
- Prefer **checklist-first**, then add a small **Appendix** with the “why” and troubleshooting.
- Keep docs concise and demo-friendly: short sections, clear headings, minimal fluff.
